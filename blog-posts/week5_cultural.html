					<p>Pairing</p>
					<p>Pairing with others to solve a problem is a skill required from any successful programmer. However, it does take some practice to utilitize them to their maximum potential. They are a great way to learn new methods. That's the most rewarding part for me. It's hard for me to learn from dry readings, but put me with a teacher/someone who can explain what they're doing, and I pick it up very fast. I have learned simpler methods and newer ways of looking at things just by listening and taking example from others. The Most frustrating part for me, however, is having to change how I work. Normally I quickly dive in and begin experimenting. With another person, I have to slow down, explain every detail, and can't do as much experimentation.</p>
					<p>Feedback</p>
					<p>When reading my feedback, I feel like I have a lot to work on! The feedback I recieved is very helpful, because it shows me how to become a better pairing partner. Next time I pair, I'm going to make sure and slow down. I need to better explain what I'm doing, that way my partner will be able to check my logic and off suggestions to keep my logic clear. Writing feedback tends to be hard for me. Unless there is something glaringly obvious I have a hard time giving someone suggestions. That might be because I am slightly timid, but I need to work on that anyway. Two birds! Overall, using pairing sessions and feedback is an excellent way to increase your programming skills.</p>
