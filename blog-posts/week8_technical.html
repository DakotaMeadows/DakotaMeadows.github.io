				<p><span id="blog">Test-Driven Development is a great way to ensure that your code is staying on track and you're reaching your goal for the program. The process relies on repeating a short cycle of steps for each function of the program. The first step is to write the test. By looking at user stories and figuring out exactly what the user wants the code to do, then write a small amount of code that will test the new function. Then run all the tests to see if the new one fails, ensuring that you are going to get a good indicator of your code. The next step is to write your code! Consider this code a rough draft. Do what you need to in order to get the test to pass. Need 50 lines for a small loop function? Go for it. Get that test passed. Run the tests and see if it does, changing what you need to on the code until there are no errors. The last step is to refactor the code. Clean up the code by removing duplication, changing names to better reflect their function, and increasing readability and maintainability to improve the code later on. Above all, keep asking the question "how can I make this more DRY?" Be sure to run the tests whenever you change the code, to ensure that your program is still executing it's required functions. From there, just decide what else you want the program to do and repeat the process!</span></p>
