				<p><span id="blog">One of my favorite sites is Foxnews.com. When first looking at the homepage, the first thing the eye is drawn to is the picture and headline of the main article. This property is maintained when standing away from the computer. This is great design because this is the most important area of the site, giving the most pressing news of the day. The website is organized and clean. It does start to feel a little crowded with the ads on the side, but only when looking at the same page for long periods of time. It is a pretty simple website, having navigation bars but not much else other than news (obviously). Pretty boring but effective. This website focuses on supplying news to its consumer, and hopes to solve ignorance of important subjects. The focus of this website is on news, so it’s informative but rather bland. It does try to throw in a little bit of sensational news, but that is delegated to the bottom, where nobody will scroll. It is effective and easy to navigate, getting to the point very quickly. Maneuvering around is very easy, with a bar at the top of every page to allow quick access to the entire site. After being on the site for a while I get a little bored because news only happens so fast.
Another one of my favorite websites is solarmovie.is. The row of upcoming movies jumps out first, and stays that way when looking at it from a distance. While the site editor’s may think this is the most important part, I would say the most important part of the site is the search bar since you usually know what movie you want to watch. The website is cluttered, with way too much stuff going on and no organization. It appears like it hasn’t been updated in a while. It’s simple and lacks much design, but people don’t go to it for that anyway. This website solves the problem of finding whatever movie you want to watch, and it contains almost every TV show and movie. The content is focused on the shows and movies, so it is rather entertaining. As for the content of the site without the streaming, it’s pretty much non-existent. It is easy to navigate from both the webpage and every other page, with a bar with every part of the website on every page. The content is easy to navigate as well, with pictures and titles for whatever you’re trying to see. After being on the site for a while I’m pretty happy, having enjoyed whatever blockbuster I viewed that day.
The last of my favorite websites is groupon.com. The “recommended for you” deal is the first thing that pops out and stays the most eye-catching from a distance. This is the most important part of the page because they’re trying to find you something they think you would like based on previous purchases. The site is very well organized and focused on finding the right deal based on your preferences. It looks very clean and up to date. This website solves the problem of acquiring discounts and exploring new interest. It contains deals ranging from food to dance classes to vacations. The content of this site is entertaining thanks to the witty site editors, but also informative based on the deal. When you have found the right deal, it is meant to conjure up excitement and leave you with a small sample of what you will experience. The site is very navigable from anywhere on the site thanks to the navigation bar on the top of every page. The content is easy to navigate as well because the preference list is on every page, as well as a search bar for specific deals. After being on the site for a while I fell excited and ready to go on whatever adventure I just bought. I have purchased a lot of things from this site because it sells its deals very well.
