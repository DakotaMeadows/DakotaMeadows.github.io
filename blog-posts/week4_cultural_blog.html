				<p><span id="blog">It seems that technological miracles happen so frequently that we have become immune to them. Want to access the entire spectrum of human knowledge? Look at your smarthphone. Want to videochat with Grandma who lives 3000 miles away? Once again, to the smartphone. As the marvels of technology are continuously produced, we tend to take them for granted. There are always problems that come along with the next big thing. One major problem facing the tech world is security. People now use their phones, tablets, and laptops for work as well as personal use. Who knows what employees are doing on the same device that holds valuable company records? The answer, unfortunately, doesn't rely solely on computer-wizards. Companies need to implement well-organized plans for their employees while IT specialists continously upgrade their security programs. It will always be a fight against those looking to steal company records, and the best way to avoid a catastrophy is to be one step ahead of those looking to hard. As for the rest of the company, guidelines needs to be enforced such as dumping the information people carry on their personal devices every time they leave work, but easily retrievable upon return.</span></p>
