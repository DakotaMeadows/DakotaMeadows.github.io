				<p><span id="blog">After taking the Gregoric Personal Thinking Style Quiz, I found I am a concrete sequential learner. I am most comfortable with a logical sequence of steps, and love working with well established facts. I learn easiest when working with someone who already knows the answers, rather than having to create my own experiments. I like predictability and learn best with a good set of instructions. Knowing this will help me during my time at DBC because their will always be someone there with more experience and knowledge, so I will do my best to work with them and follow their directions to succeed. The biggest struggle for me so far during Phase 0 has been teaching myself the concepts. This relates to my thinking style because there isn't a person always there who has already mastered the concepts. Experiementation is always a rough way to learn for me. One way I can overcome this is to attend more office hours, and reach out for help from the people in my cohort. However, there is another, very impactful way, to overcome my struggles as a concrete sequential person: increasing my growth mindset and diminishing my fixed mindset. By focusing on subjects I struggle with, instead of avoiding them, I can learn new tricks and develop a better confidence when having a hard time completing tasks. Instead of heavily critiquing myself, I should focus on the learning itself and finding constructive criticism to continue acquiring knowledge.</span></p>
