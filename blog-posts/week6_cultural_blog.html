				<p><span id="blog">Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic,a negative stereotype about one's group. I can't say that I have ever felt it, but the groups focused on during the studies were African-Americans with verbal tests and women with math. A way to combat stereotype threat is to represent the tests as not favoring any race/gender, as well es being very explicit about high standards and the feedback is given to help students reach those standards. With the idea that someone is being graded differently based on their race or gender, the studies conducted showed that those who originally suffered from stereotype threat scored just as well as everyone else. This phenomenon is not limited to minorities or women. A same test was conducted on white males when told that Asians usually score higher on a certain test. The students did better when this statement was taken out of the instructions.</span></p>
