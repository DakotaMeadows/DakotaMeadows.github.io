				<p><span id="blog">My take on the DBC experience is that it goes far beyond coding. It tries to grow you as a person, while also giving you an excellent experience in software development. A lot of challenges are mixed with a lot of tools to help you overcome them. Creating well-rounded people as well as excellent coders seems to be the goal. I see myself jumping right into the curriculum (including doing the yoga more than the two mandatory sessions!). I hope to ingrain a lot of the culture into the rest of my life in order to overcome whatever different obstacles crop up in the future. My expectations of DBC have drastically changed. I thought it would be a monkey-see monkey-do way of learning, but instead they force you to learn a lot by exploration and working with others. I am very excited to participate in this environment. Everyone seems eager to becoming fully immersed into the system and grow together. I am a little nervous because computer programming is an entirely new experience for me, but I’m excited because I got through the first week. Only 17 more to go! Something that struck me from the video was about working in a team. Every company is a team, and going solo and never working well with others is an easy way to find that nobody is there when you need them. Working together utilizes everyone’s strengths, and builds upon your own foundations.</span></p>
