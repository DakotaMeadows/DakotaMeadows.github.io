				<p><span id="blog">Unless you have never used a computer, you know the word "JavaScript." Everyone, even if they haven't done any software development or website design, has at least heard of the programming language. It is seen as "the language of the web," and every browser supports it. That in itself is big, because as a web developer you don't want to have to write different code with different languages just to get your idea to work on every page. As an offshoot to this, since everyone already uses JS for their websites, it has huge libraries for everything your site needs (is it a mobile site? Have a lot of special affects?). JavaScript, being embedded in browsers, drastically reduces the speed for your site to load. Instead of having to call up the code from another server. This lowers the load time because the site can quickly call the code it needs with less time spent waiting on a response! Speaking of speed, the programmer can see the results immediately when tinkering with the code, instead of changing the code, uploading the changes, and refreshing the page. Seeing your work in action with tedious side jobs keeps up motivation, and everyone loves ease of access. Despite its huge success and great benefits, JavaScript does have its downsides. Because the code put into the website is executed on the user's computer, some security issues are raised, and many people may disable JavaScript. Another issue is that although every browser supports JS, it may not look the same on every browers. Your output on IE9 could be completely different than a user running Chrome (one way to get around this would be to just test your code using every browser).</span></p>
