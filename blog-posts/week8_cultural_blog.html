				<p><span id="blog">One of the times I had an emotional conflict with someone was early Junior High. My older brother and I had been at each other's throats for around a year. It seemed like we could never agree on anything, and were always fighting. I'm not sure why the whole dispute started, but after a while, it didn't matter. We were in a perpetual war. Both being young, it wasn't resolved well. We eventually got into a fistfight. Although he is older, I've always been more stocky, and so I overpowered him. I hit him a few times and he started bleeding badly. At that sight I couldn't do it anymore. I got up, bloody shirt and all, and went to a very good family friend's house. It was the worst feeling of my life. Eventually I returned home, where my father and brother were waiting to talk about everything. The sight of his bloodied face still haunts me. I've always had a hard time forgiving myself, and I don't think I'll ever get over that moment. Interestingly, my brother and I hugged it out, and have been friends ever since. Something big just needed to knock us out of our funk I guess. However, if I could go back in time, I would never lay a finger on him. I would have taken the mature way and just talked to him. Apologized and done the right thing. Physical violence is never necessary. Even though it fixed the issue, the terrible feeling in my gut when I remember that day will never go away.</span></p>
