				<p><span id="blog">When I think of the times in my life where I've been the most proud, 2 values come to mind: leadership and will-power. Leadership is important to me because I want to make an impact on those around me, and what better way than to be blazing the trail that others follow? It also keeps me sharp and focused, since others are counting on me. Will-power is just as vital in my life, because it is what drives me to become better and to actually finish what I started. Without it, I wouldn't be able to grit my teeth and complete tasks. For these reasons, I always try to live up to these values. 
				<br>
				The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was when my friend was deciding what school to go to. He was an excellent ballet dancer, and couldn't decide on Houston or New York ballet companies (and their appropriate school programs). Whenever someone is asking for advice, leadership is essential to helping. Asking the tough questions, making them delve deeper into the issues while assuring them whatever they do, they will succeed. Will-power is also needed to tell them how you really feel, since they can reject your advice but you still need to give it.
				<br>
				When I think about my values, I feel like I can conquer the world. By adhering to them and strengthening them, I can become the man I want to become. These values can definitely mediate stereotype threat if I recognize it, because it takes a leader to step up and cast light on an issue, as well as the will-power to become such a leader. 
				If I'm ever feeling down at DBC, some physical things I can do is get active. Try to get others to join me and just burn out the negativity. I can also take some time to meditate and cleanse my head from whatever worries I have created for myself.
