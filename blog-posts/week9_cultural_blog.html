				<p><span id="blog">There a main points to keep in mind when asking a question. The first one, and obviously the easiest one, is whether or not you are asking a question in person or posting it online. In person you can be a lot more vague when starting, because you can go into more detail later. Questions asked in person would be useless online (example: "I have a Ruby Class Issue"). So for this post I'm going to go in depth with asking questions over the internet. 
				<h1>Be Specific</h1>
				The biggest key is to be specific. After writing your question, read it over and try to put yourself in an outsider's shoes, who is coming into your situation cold. Is there anything that would be confusing? Better to add too much than not enough. That being said, be careful not to go on tangents either. 
				<h1>Be Precise</h1>
				It's a good idea to put the general concept of what you're trying to achieve with the entire program, but you don't need to put meticulous details from every aspect of your code, just what you're having issues with. For example, if you copy and paste your code into your question (which is recommended) and you're having an issue on line 32, don't paste lines 1-130!
				<h1>Have English Skills</h1>
				This one isn't the most important, but I would argue is the easiest way for someone to skip your question. Have good punctuation and grammar, so people can actually read what you're trying to ask. If a person sees "Me kode no gr8" they're going to ponder the stupidity of man for a second and then move on. 
				<h1>Be Open</h1>
				Lastly, be active in looking at the question you posted. If people are commenting with questions to clear up what you're asking, make sure to give more details. If someone correctly answered your questions, make sure the online community knows so people don't waste any more effort and can help other people. If the question hasn't been answered in a way you find acceptable, respond stating why. Help those you help you!
