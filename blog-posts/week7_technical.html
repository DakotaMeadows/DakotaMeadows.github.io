				<p><span id="blog">So this week at DBC we've been learning how to use SQL (Structured Query Language) databases for organizing and storing data. I feel like a fancy accountant. However, I have just been informed of a different method called NoSQL(how original). After researching and comparing the two, it seems there are pros and cons to each method. The biggest con for SQL is when it meets a large amount of data. As the amount of data increases, so does performance, and is not scalable enough to handle very large amounts of information. NoSQL, however, was designed for such a large amount of data. Another good thing about NoSQL is you don't need to know in advance exactly what kind of data you'll be collecting and storing. NoSQL can do this because it has distributed databases. Unstructured data can be stored across multiple processing nodes and servers. As more data comes in, just add more hardware and the performance won't falter. NoSQL comes with problems of it's own though. It takes a lot more expertise to successfully utilize NoSQL, and support appears to be lacking. Large companies such as IBM and Oracle use SQL, so there is a more research and resources pouring into SQL, and therefore more chances to find solutions to any issues that pop up. Overall, I am more looking forward to working with NoSQL. I haven't experienced it yet, a lot of start-ups are driving its production, and since I want to work at one, it would be a benefit to learn.</span></p>
