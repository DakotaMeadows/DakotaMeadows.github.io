      <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
      <p>Pair programming is two people working together on a project. There are normally two roles when pair programming; the driver and the navigator. 
      The driver will usually be the one on the keyboard while the navigator keeps the driver focused and make sure the direction of the project is correct. 
      These roles can easily switch back and forth depending on the flow of the work. 
      Pairing has a huge teaching element attached to it, as each person will gain better insights and skills no matter who they are working with.</p>
      <hr><h2>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h2>
      <p>Pair Programming is important to DBC because it sets the students up for the work environment they will be entering upon graduation.
        It also allows the students to get to know each other before the on-site element of the program. Starting off comfortably will allow us to jump right into the work.
        Peer programming is excellent way to learn off each other and gain insights that we normally wouldn't reach ourselves. '
      </p>
      <hr><h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
      <p>The driver is the one typing. The navigator focuses on leading the driver, overseeing any mistakes in the the code and making sure the driver is on track.
        The roles can be easily switched for various reasons: new ideas, fatigue, different expressions, etc.

    <footer>Overall, I enjoy pairing. It helps me solidify concepts and even learn new ones. It's a great way to work with others and gives me an opportunity to understand what the real work environment will be upon graduation of DBC.</footer>
